## Rules for setting a password policy<a name="password-policy-rules"></a>

* IAM password policy
  * does NOT apply | 
    * AWS account root user password or
    * IAM user access keys
      * ðŸ‘€-> if a password expires -> IAM user can ðŸ‘€
        * NOT sign in | AWS Management Console
        * use their access keys
  * if you create or change -> password policy settings
    * MOST are enforced | next time / users change their passwords
      * _Example:_ minimum length & character type requirements change
    * SOME are enforced immediately
      * _Example:_ set a password expiration period
        * set a password expiration period of 90 days -> password expires | ALL IAM users / password is older than 90 days
  * recommendations
    * strong password policy + MFA
      * see [Using multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) in AWS](id_credentials_mfa.md)

* "lockout policy"
  * == policy / lock a user out of the account
  * ðŸ‘€NOT possible to create it ðŸ‘€

## Permissions required -- to set a -- password policy<a name="default-policy-permissions-required"></a>

* goal
  * required permissions / IAM entity (user or role) can, about their account password policy
    * view
    * edit

* password policy actions 
  + `iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy`
    + -> entity can view the password policy | their account
  + `iam:DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy` 
    + -> entity can
      + delete the custom password policy | their account
      + revert -- to the -- default password policy
  + `iam:UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy`

## Default password policy<a name="default-policy-details"></a>

* uses
  * administrator does NOT set a custom password policy

* default password policy
  + password length [8, 128] characters
  + \>= 3 of the following character types
    + uppercase,
    + lowercase,
    + numbers,
    + non\-alphanumeric character \(`! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | '`\)
  + != your AWS account name or email address
  + NEVER expire password

## Custom password policy options<a name="password-policy-details"></a>

* TODO:
When you configure a custom password policy for your account, you can specify the following conditions:
+ **Password minimum length** â€“ You can specify a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 128 characters\.
+ **Password strength** â€“ You can select any of the following check boxes to define the strength of your IAM user passwords:
  + Require at least one uppercase letter from the Latin alphabet \(Aâ€“Z\)
  + Require at least one lowercase letter from the Latin alphabet \(aâ€“z\)
  + Require at least one number
  + Require at least one nonalphanumeric character `! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | '` 
+ **Turn on password expiration** â€“ You can select and specify a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 1,095 days that IAM user passwords are valid after they are set\. For example, if you specify an expiration of 90 days, it immediately impacts all of your users\. For users with passwords older than 90 days, when they log into the console after the change, they must set a new password\. Users with passwords 75\-89 days old receive an AWS Management Console warning about their password expiration\. IAM users can change their password at any time if they have permission\. When they set a new password, the expiration period for that password starts over\. An IAM user can have only one valid password at a time\.
+ **Password expiration requires administrator reset** â€“ Select this option to prevent IAM users from using the AWS Management Console to update their own passwords after the password expires\. Before you select this option, confirm that your AWS account has more than one user with administrative permissions to reset IAM user passwords\. Administrators with `iam:UpdateLoginProfile` permission can reset IAM user passwords\. IAM users with `iam:ChangePassword` permission and active access keys can reset their own IAM user console password programmatically\. If you clear this check box, IAM users with expired passwords must still set a new password before they can access the AWS Management Console\.
+ **Allow users to change their own password** â€“ You can permit all IAM users in your account to change their own password\. This gives users access to the `iam:ChangePassword` action for only their user and to the `iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy` action\. This option does not attach a permissions policy to each user\. Rather, IAM applies the permissions at the account\-level for all users\. Alternatively, you can allow only some users to manage their own passwords\. To do so, you clear this check box\. For more information about using policies to limit who can manage passwords, see [Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\.
+ **Prevent password reuse** â€“ You can prevent IAM users from reusing a specified number of previous passwords\. You can specify a minimum number of 1 and a maximum number of 24 previous passwords that can't be repeated\.
