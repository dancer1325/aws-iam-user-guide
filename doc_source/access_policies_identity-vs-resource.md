* _Example:_ 
  * identity-based policies
    * *resource\-level permission* | identity\-based policy
      * == actions -- can be -- performed | specific resources
        * _Example:_ user `JohnSmith` can perform some actions | `Resource X`
  * resource-based policies
    * _Example:_ | `Resource X`, `Resource Y`, and `Resource Z`
