* AWS Management Console session
  * by default, 1 hour
    * vs IAM user sessions = 12 hours, by default
  * way to determine the switch role session duration
    
    | IAM user session time remaining isâ€¦ | Role session duration isâ€¦ | 
    | --- | --- | 
    | < role maximum session duration | Time remaining in user session | 
    | \> role maximum session duration | Maximum session duration value | 
    | == role maximum session duration | Maximum session duration value \(approximate\) |
